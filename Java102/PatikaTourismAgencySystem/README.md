# Hotel Agency Program

This is an example of a hotel agency program prepared for the "PatikaDev Java 102" course.
The program focuses on hotel addition operations.
Please note that this is a homework project and, as such, the implementation of hotel room addition and sales operations is not included at this stage.
However, other functionalities can be added to the program by following a similar logic as the hotel addition process.
